## Welcome to the Baazaar Explorer

This is very much a ðŸš§work in progressðŸš§. Mostly getting the basics setup.

Have a look at [gotchis](/gotchis) and [tickets](/tickets) to get an idea.

I've got a few more figures and tables I want to include with the data you can get 
from [thegraph](https://thegraph.com/explorer/subgraph/aavegotchi/aavegotchi-core-matic). TheGraph does have some limitations which I hadn't realised but will come to those later.

Feel free to drop me an email hi @ aavagotchi.fyi with any suggestions. Code is on [github](https://github.com/alexjj/baazaar-explorer).
