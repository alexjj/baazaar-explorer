            Analyse historical sales and compare to current listings. Eventually have a price prediction for your gotchi.

            ### Wearables
            Past and current wearables, look up specific ones

            ### Tickets
            Prices of tickets over time

            ### Stats
            More stats about the Aavegotchi universe - total value of gotchi and items etc.
